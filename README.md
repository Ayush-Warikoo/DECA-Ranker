# DECA_Ranker

## Description
DECA is an international business competition with students competing from all over the world. 
As an executive on my high school's DECA team, I created this python program to automate the process of putting students into business events, each of which have a limited number of spots. The program improved the number of students who were given one of their top three picks, while also ensuring that the best students were prioritized. 
The program ordered students based on previous placements, years of experience as well as preferences which was all collected through google forms and stored in CSV files.
